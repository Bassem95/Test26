			<p>In the age of rapidly reporting, digital news, there is rarely a single "final" version of an article. Now readers can view "the making of the sausage" that historically was discretely hidden from view with dead-tree editions.
			<p>Thus the NewDiffer was born of the <a href="http://opennews-mit.eventbrite.com/">Knight Mozilla MIT hackathon</a> on June 17, 2012. 
			<p>The NewsDiffer watches different versions of highly-placed New York Times articles (e.g. mainly <a href="http://nytimes.com">the front page</a>) as they evolve over time. 
			<p>Sometimes the changes are simply minor, small edits that are tightening of (such as "most" to "many.")
			<p>Other times, the changes reflect choices in connotation (sometimes political) for example, whether <a href="http://ecprice.scripts.mit.edu/newsdiffer/diffview?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/world/middleeast/egyptian-presidential-vote-enters-second-day.html&v1=c21d75799d83220e7ec796a198f782b6c57e1758&v2=d2778475ba76046b0f5b05bb4df2640962442dad">an election was "democratic" vs. "competitive."</a>
			<p>In still others, the lead and the substance of the articles can substantially change, such as in the story that inspired this project: the article about the arrests of Occupy Wall Street protestors on October 1, 2011 that is pictured above. Two versions, twenty minutes apart, had substantially different first paragraphs, shifting responsibility for the conflicts and arrests.</p>
			<p>
			<p>
			<p> Another interesting example would have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">the killing of Osama Bin Laden</a> on May 1, 2011, which broke at 10:40 p.m. with a sparse report from Helene Cooper: 
			<blockquote>WASHINGTON â€” Osama bin Laden has been killed, a United States official said. President Obama is expected to make an announcement on Sunday night, almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</blockquote>
			
			
			<p><strong>How it works</strong>: NewsDiffer regularly looks at the stories that are linked to (or have been linked to) from the homepage of nytimes.com as well as other leading pages, such as the opinion page. 
			It parses them and stores them in a git repository. 
				
			The records start June 17, 2012. Not all articles are stored. The NewsDiffer focuses mostly on ones that are linked from the homepage.
